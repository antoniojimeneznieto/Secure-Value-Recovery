1. All weeks have been completed.

2. No special remarks

3. Potential improvements of our code :

-Due to lack of time in the final weeks, W10-13 lack modularity and more separation. (some functions are near 100 lines of code !)

-Although in the early weeks, our macro M_REQUIRE_ELSE_RUN_EXIT_CODE seemed to be enough for this project, it became clear
in the last weeks that it still created a lot of duplicate code and became hard to read (this problem is
especially visible in ckvs_httpd and ckvs_client get and set, in part because of the lack of modularity too).

-All weeks until the 2nd submission have some modularity, but we would have liked to modify them to make them easily usable
in the weeks W10-13.
